## What it does
NEW FEATURE: WISHLIST FILTERS!

- Adds a filter option to only display games with demos.
- Adds a tag next to each item that has a demo available.
- Both the filter and the tagging systems distinguish demos by platform (i.e. Windows, Mac, or Linux/Steam Deck), which not always are the same platforms supported by the full game.



'demos in my Steam wishlist' is activated every time you access a wishlist page at https://store.steampowered.com.

## Privacy

No login is required.

We don't access your personal data.

We only use publicly available data provided by Steam itself.

## Notice

If the filter misbehaves in any way (e.g. the filter options are not rendered), open your wishlist in a new tab (instead of simply refreshing the page), and everything should be fine again. 

We are working on a solution for this.
