## What it does
'demos in my Steam wishlist' is activated every time you access a wishlist page at https://store.steampowered.com. It adds a tag next to the games that have a demo available.

The tag also includes the platforms supported by the demo (i.e. Windows, Mac or Linux / Steam Deck) - which not always are the same as the full game.
